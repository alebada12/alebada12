### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Little bit about me:

I'm currently working on my senior design project which looks to include a good portion of mechatronic concepts.

Also working on automating my personal finances. Through Python, I hope to have all credits/debits from various credit card/debit cards input into my budget tracker spreadsheet.

I'm currently learning more about PLCs and how having a mechanical engineering background can help in controls heavy roles.
